    <img src="./images/Screenshot_20230706-151537_1.jpg" alt="image">
    <br>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional Sport: Camel racing is a popular traditional sport in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. It

            <br>
        <li>Ancient Origins: Camel racing has a history that dates back thousands of years in the Arabian Peninsula. It
            was originally a means of transportation and an important aspect of Bedouin life in the desert.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Professional Racing Tracks: Dubai is home to dedicated camel racing tracks that are specially designed for
            the sport. These tracks feature long straightaways, allowing camels to reach high speeds during races.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Racing Camels: Specially trained racing camels are used in competitions. These camels are bred and raised
            specifically for racing, and they undergo extensive training to improve their speed and racing abilities.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Remote-Controlled Robot Jockeys: In the past, young children were used as jockeys in camel races. However,
            to address ethical concerns, regulations now require the use of remote-controlled robot jockeys. These
            lightweight robots are mounted on the camels and controlled by trainers who follow alongside the track.</li>
        <li>High-Speed Races: Camel races can reach impressive speeds, with camels running at an average speed of around
            40-50 kilometers per hour (25-31 miles per hour). Some camels can reach speeds of up to 60 kilometers per
            hour (37 miles per hour).</li>
            <br>
        <li>Technological Advancements: Over the years, technology has been integrated into camel racing. Modern tracks
            have electronic timing systems, video cameras, and other monitoring equipment to track and record race
            results accurately.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
        <li>Popular Spectator Sport: Camel racing attracts a large number of spectators, both locals and tourists, who
            gather to watch the races. The atmosphere is lively, with cheering crowds and traditional music adding to
            the excitement.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Seasonal Events: Camel racing in Dubai is primarily held during the winter months, typically from October to
            April. During this time, various races and competitions take place, drawing camel owners, trainers, and
            enthusiasts from around the region.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Cultural Experience: Attending a camel race provides visitors with an opportunity to experience the rich
            Arabian culture and witness a traditional sport that has been part of the region's heritage for centuries.

        THE PALM ISLANDS
    </h1>
    <video src="./videos/palm.mp4" controls height="500" width=""></video>
    <br>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engineering Marvel: The Palm Islands are considered one of the world's most ambitious engineering projects.
            They are artificial islands constructed in the shape of palm trees, visible from space.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Three Palm Islands: The project consists of three main islands: Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali (currently
            under development), and Palm Deira (planned). Each island is designed in the shape of a palm tree, with a
            trunk, fronds, and a crescent-shaped breakwater.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Palm Jumeirah: Palm Jumeirah is the first and most famous of the Palm Islands. It was completed in 2006 and
            is home to luxurious residential villas, hotels, resorts, and a variety of entertainment and leisure
            facilities.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Engineering Techniques: The construction of the Palm Islands involved extensive dredging and land
            reclamation. Sand was brought in from the sea and shaped into the palm tree structure using a process called
            vibro-compaction.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Palm Fronds: The fronds of the palm trees are lined with residential properties, including villas and
            apartments. The properties offer stunning views of the Arabian Gulf and the Dubai skyline.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Crescent Breakwater: The crescent-shaped breakwater surrounding each palm island serves as a protective
            barrier against waves and tidal forces. It helps to maintain calm waters within the island and prevent
            erosion.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Atlantis, The Palm: One of the most iconic landmarks on Palm Jumeirah is Atlantis, The Palm. This luxury
            hotel and resort features a distinct architectural design and offers a range of attractions, including an
            aquarium, water park, and marine animal encounters.</li>
            <br>

        <li>Accessibility: The Palm Islands are connected to the mainland via underwater tunnels and bridges. This
            allows easy access for residents, visitors, and transportation.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Environmental Impact: The construction of the Palm Islands involved significant environmental
            considerations. Artificial coral reefs were created to promote marine life, and measures were taken to
            preserve the surrounding ecosystems.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Tourism and Iconic Status: The Palm Islands have become one of Dubai's most recognizable landmarks and a
            symbol of its ambition and luxury. They attract tourists from around the world who come to marvel at the
            engineering feat and enjoy the luxurious amenities offered on the islands.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Palm Jumeirah: Palm Jumeirah is the smallest and the first completed island among the three Palm Islands. It
            is shaped like a palm tree and consists of a trunk, 16 fronds, and a crescent-shaped breakwater. The island
            has a mix of residential, commercial, and leisure properties, including luxurious villas, apartments,
            hotels, restaurants, and shopping malls.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Palm Jebel Ali: Palm Jebel Ali is the second largest of the Palm Islands and is currently under development.
            Once completed, it will be twice the size of Palm Jumeirah. The island is expected to house a mix of
            residential and commercial developments, including hotels, entertainment facilities, and an underwater
            hotel.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Palm Deira: Palm Deira, the third and largest of the Palm Islands, is still in the planning stage. It is
            expected to be larger than Palm Jumeirah and Palm Jebel Ali combined. The island will feature a mix of
            residential, commercial, and entertainment zones, including shopping centers, hotels, marinas, and
            waterfront promenades.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Construction and Land Reclamation: The construction of the Palm Islands involved extensive land reclamation.
            Sand and rocks were brought in from the sea and placed on the seabed to create the foundations of the
            islands. The process of land reclamation required careful planning and engineering techniques to ensure the
            stability and sustainability of the islands.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Iconic Landmarks: The Palm Islands are home to several iconic landmarks, including the Atlantis, The Palm
            resort on Palm Jumeirah. The resort features luxurious accommodations, a water park called Aquaventure, The
            Lost Chambers Aquarium, and various dining and entertainment options.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Transport and Connectivity: The Palm Islands are connected to the mainland through a series of bridges and
            an underwater tunnel. This allows for easy access to the islands by residents, visitors, and transportation.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>World Records: The Palm Islands have achieved several world records, including being the largest artificial
            islands in the world. Palm Jumeirah, in particular, holds the record for being the largest man-made island,
            extending over 5 kilometers into the Arabian Gulf.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Environmental Considerations: During the construction of the Palm Islands, environmental considerations were
            taken into account. Artificial coral reefs were created around the islands to promote marine life and
            enhance the biodiversity of the area. The breakwaters also help to prevent erosion and maintain the
            stability of the islands.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Tourism and Real Estate: The Palm Islands have become major tourist destinations and sought-after
            residential areas. The luxurious properties and stunning waterfront views attract residents and visitors
            alike. The islands offer a unique and opulent lifestyle, with a range of amenities and services available
            within close proximity.</li>
